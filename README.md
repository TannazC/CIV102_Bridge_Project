CIV102_Bridge_Project

Project Overview:
Designed, analyzed, and constructed a 1.25m-long matboard bridge to withstand increasing loads, optimizing structural integrity through iterative engineering design, computational modelling, and experimental validation. The project incorporated beam theory, thin plate buckling theory, and structural failure analysis to achieve an optimal, material-efficient design with a predicted failure load of 1212.2 N.

My Role:
Developed a Python-based structural analysis tool that automated the calculation of shear forces, bending moments, flexural stresses, and multiple failure modes (shear, axial, glue, and buckling) based on iterative changes to the bridge's matboard cross-section dimensions. Designed an object-oriented framework to dynamically adjust the centroidal height, moment of inertia, and stress distributions as design parameters were modified, enabling efficient optimization of structural integrity.

Implemented real-time factor of safety (FOS) evaluations, determining weak points in the structure and refining the design based on safety thresholds. Programmed shear force diagrams (SFD), bending moment diagrams (BMD), and failure capacity envelopes using Matplotlib and NumPy, providing a clear visual representation of load distributions and stress concentrations.

Integrated moving load simulations to assess how the train's varying positions influenced stress distributions, ensuring the model accounted for real-world dynamic loading scenarios. Validated computational results through hand calculations and cross-referencing with theoretical expectations, ensuring accuracy in failure predictions.

Additionally, contributed to the physical construction by applying precision cutting, staggered splicing techniques, and diaphragm placements to reinforce load-bearing capacity and structural efficiency, ensuring alignment between computational predictions and real-world bridge performance.
