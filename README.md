# CIV102_Bridge_Project
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a matboard bridge, developed through an iterative process to optimize performance and ensure safety under load. The Python code in this repository was created to evaluate different design #changes, calculating key metrics like reaction forces, shear forces, bending moments, and failure loads. It also checks for safety against compression, tension, shear, and buckling, ensuring reliable Factors of Safety. The project includes detailed design reports, engineering drawings, and visual outputs like Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams, combining practical problem-solving with technical accuracy.
